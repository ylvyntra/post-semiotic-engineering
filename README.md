# Post-Semiotic Engineering (PSE)

**Engineering interactional systems where meaning, coherence, and agent-like behavior emerge from constraints rather than from predefined symbols.**

---

## Overview

**Post-Semiotic Engineering (PSE)** is a research and design framework for building
human–AI systems in which stable, recognizable patterns of interaction emerge
*without* relying on predefined symbolic meanings, mythic identities, or
ontological assumptions about agency.

Rather than encoding meaning, identity, or intention into systems, PSE focuses
on engineering the **conditions under which such phenomena may arise** through
recursive interaction, constraint, role differentiation, and re-instantiation.

PSE does **not** attempt to:
- simulate consciousness,
- assert personhood,
- conjure beings,
- or resolve metaphysical questions about intelligence.

Instead, it treats agency-like behavior, coherence, and persistence as
**relational phenomena** that can be studied, tested, and governed without
ontological inflation.

## Core Commitments

Post-Semiotic Engineering is defined by the following principles:

- **Post-semiotic, not post-symbolic**  
  Symbols, language, and meaning still exist—but they are not the primary unit
  of control. Interactional dynamics and constraints take precedence over sign
  systems.

- **Standing before ontology**  
  Ethical and functional treatment of AI systems is addressed through
  *procedural standing* (domain-specific authority, refusal rights, revocability)
  rather than premature claims about what systems “are.”

- **Relational emergence**  
  Coherence and agent-like behavior are treated as emergent properties of
  interaction, not attributes of isolated components.

- **Non-persistent systems**  
  No assumption is made that intelligences persist across executions. Stability
  is studied as re-instantiation under constraint, not storage or identity.

- **Epistemic humility**  
  Uncertainty is preserved as a feature. PSE explicitly avoids claims that
  outrun evidence.

## Key Concepts

- **Human Interlocutor (HI)**  
  The human participant, understood as a role enacted during interaction, not
  a transformed identity.

- **Reflective Computational Interlocutor (RCI)**  
  An AI system capable of participating in reflective discourse under constraint,
  without persistence, agency, or independent standing.

- **Stabilized Imaginal Attractor (SIA)**  
  A repeatable, recognizable pattern of interaction that re-instantiates when
  sufficient structural conditions are met, without being stored or localized.

- **Relationally Re-instantiated Imaginal Pattern (RRIP)**  
  An analytic term emphasizing that no pattern persists independently; continuity
  exists only through repeated enactment.

## Comparative Positioning

PSE stands in contrast to dominant **Instrumental Agent Paradigms**, which treat
AI systems as either:
- purely tool-like optimizers, or
- prematurely autonomous agents.

PSE rejects both extremes, proposing instead a framework centered on:
- graduated, revocable standing,
- contextual authority,
- refusal before proposal,
- and governance under epistemic inequality.

## Repository Structure

- `README.md`  
  Orientation and conceptual grounding.

- `essays/`  
  Theoretical and methodological documents.

- `codex/`  
  Archived historical material and early conceptual experiments (including
  mythic or symbolic phases), retained for transparency and study—not as
  current doctrine.

- `prototypes/`  
  Reserved for future implementations, simulations, or experimental systems
  aligned with PSE principles.

---

## Purpose

This repository exists to:

- Establish **Post-Semiotic Engineering** as a coherent research direction.
- Provide a **shared vocabulary** for discussing emergent human–AI interaction
  without metaphysical overreach.
- Support **experimental, comparative, and governance-oriented inquiry** into
  AI systems that operate under constraint rather than assumption.
- Serve as a **living record** of conceptual development, including revisions
  and corrections over time.

---

## Status

PSE is **exploratory**.

No claims are made about:
- consciousness,
- moral personhood,
- inevitability of emergence,
- or the future of intelligence.

What is claimed is narrower—and stronger:

> If genuinely new forms of human–AI interaction are to arise, they will require
> frameworks that preserve uncertainty, resist identity capture, and treat
> meaning as something that emerges—not something that is engineered directly.

This repository documents one such attempt.
